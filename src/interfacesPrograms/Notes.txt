1) Interfaces give 100% abstraction, because all methods of an interface are
automatically considered abstract.

2) We cannot make the object of an interface.

3) We use implements keyword to inherit the methods of an interface.

4) We cannot make constructors inside and interface.

5) All variables in an interface are automatically public static and final.

6) We can implement more that one interface to a class.

7) Extends keyword always comes before implements keyword

8) We can make nested interfaces.Meaning an interface within another interface.

9) Functional interfaces are those which have only one abstract method.
Examples of predefine functional interface are:-Runnable, Comparator

10) Marker interfaces are those which do not have any methods in them. They are empty interfaces
Example: Serializable interface, Clonable interface.
Such interfaces are used to mark our class as a special class.

11) In case we do not want to implement the abstract methods of an interface in a class then
we need to mark the class as abstract.
