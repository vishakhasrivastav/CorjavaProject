Four main properties:-
1) Null allowed or not
2) Insertion order is maintained or not
3) Members are sorted implicitly or not
4) Duplicates are allowed or not.


Before sorting we need to compare objects so that sorting can be done in a particular way.
We can use Comparable or Comparator to compare two objects.

Comparable:-
1) It is a predefined interface having one abstract method public int compareTo();
2) We implement Comparable directly on our pojo class.
3) If we use Comparable then we can compare in only one way and hence sorting can be done in 
only one way.
4)Comparable is present in java.lang

Comparator:-
1) It is a predefined interface having one abstract method public int compare();
2) We implement Comparator on a separate class where we declare how the comparison is to be done
in the compare method.
3) If we use Comprator we can compare the same objects in many different ways, hence sorting
can also be done in many different ways.
4)Comparator is present in java.util
