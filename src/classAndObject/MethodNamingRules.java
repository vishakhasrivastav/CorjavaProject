		 * Naming rules for variables:-
		 * 1) Name should start with small letter.
		 * 2) It cannot start with a number, the name can contain numbers in between or end.
		 * 3) Spaces are not allowed. Only $ or _ special character are allowed in names.
		 * 4) Java is case sensitive. Capital letter is different form small letter.
		 * 5)We cannot use keywords as identifiers. Keywords are words that have a predefined meaning. 
		 * They are reserved words
		 * 6)If the name of the variable has more than one words then use camel casing, meaning a word after another
		 * will start with capital.
		 * 7) Method names should usually be a verb describing the work it is going to
		 * do in the method.
