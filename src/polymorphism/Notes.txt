Difference between Method overloading and Method overriding:-

1) In method overloading same named methods are in the same class
	In method overriding same named methods are in different classes, one
	parent class the other is the child class.

2) Inheritance is not concerned in method overloading
	For method overriding inheritance must be there.
	
3) In method overloading methods have same name but parameters must be different.
	In method overriding the name is same and also parameters must be same.
	
4) Overloading is used to do the same task with different variations.
	Overriding is used to change the behavior of the inherited method in child class.
	
	
5) In method overloading the access specifier is not considered, hence we can keep any access
specifier.
	In method overriding we can only increase the accessibility of the overridden method, we
	can never decrease the accessibility.
