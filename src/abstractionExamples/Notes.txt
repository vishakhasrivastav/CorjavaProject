1) Abstract class objects cannot be created because abstract class is an 
incomplete class having abstract methods.

2) If we do not want to implement the abstract method in child class then
we have to declare the child class also abstract.

3) abstract keyword and final keyword can never be used together.

4) abstract class gives partial abstraction, because an abstract class has
concrete methods and abstract methods also.
For full abstraction we have to use interfaces
