Types of inheritance:-

1) Single inheritance: One parent class and one child class
2) Multilevel inheritance: One parent has one child class and this child class
							is parent to another class
3) Hierarchical inheritance: One parent which has many child classes

4) Multiple inheritance: One child has many parents. This is not allowed in java

5) Hybrid inheritance: One class has multiple child classes and these child classes are parent
						to one class.
						
Point to remember:-
1) If parent class and child class both have members with same name then we can call parent class
member with super keyword.

2) When we make child class object the first call will always go to the non parameterized 
constructor of parent.
But as a developer if we want the first call to go to some other constructor inside parent
then we can explicitly call the parent constructor using super keyword.
